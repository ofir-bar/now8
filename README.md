# Now8 - Native Android Client

## Now8 automates the process of notfying each passenger when their driver is nearby their location.
For example: A group of 5 friends go out tonight. Bob is the driver; he can invite his friends to join the ride. Once Bob's friends join the ride, they will get notified a few minutes before Bob arrives to their house. Bob don't need to call each friend and wait for him outside of his house.

## About this version
This version is the Android Mobile Client, there is also an iOS mobile client(to be released soon) and a backend side.

## Now8 Architecture (only for creating & joining a ride)
