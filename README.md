# Now8 - Native Android Client written in Java

## :exclamation:Note: This app is being rewritten in Kotlin from scratch, on a private repo. I keep the documentation for those interested to learn about this project. :exclamation:

## Now8 automates the process of notifying each passenger on their driver arrival
Use case: A group of 5 friends go out tonight. Bob is the driver; he can invite his friends to join the ride. Once Bob's friends join the ride, they will get notified a few minutes before Bob arrival to their location. Bob don't need to call each friend while driving and wait for him to get outside of his house.

## About this version
This version is the Android Mobile Client, there is also an iOS mobile client(to be released soon) and a backend side written in Python (Serverless)

## Features, Tools and Design used
Frontend:
- This app follows the [Android MVP Architecture](https://antonioleiva.com/mvp-android/)
- [Retrofit library](https://github.com/square/retrofit) is used to make REST network requests to the backend
- [Scarlet library](https://github.com/Tinder/Scarlet) is used to create WebSocket connection to the database, this is to have backend-frontend communication in real time. The server needs to notify all the passengers on the driver location
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) Reactive Extensions for the JVM â€“ a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM
- [Auth0 library](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android) is used to simplify the integration with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) service, used for user login and authentication
- [Google Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/intro) - to show the driver location on a map
- [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start) - used to calculate ETA from the driver to a specific passenger.

Backend:
- All the backend infrastracture (Databases, API, etc) is written in AWS-specific code that translates to AWS infrastracture.
- This is possible using the [AWS Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
- I use the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) to simplify the process and allow me to not being "locked down" to AWS.
Code-to-infrastracture can be easily duplicated to create the entire infrastracture from scratch in many areas on the world.

The server side uses AWS intensively and is written in Python(on a private repo):
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to create all the required functions (create_ride, join_ride,etc)
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) to trigger Lambda functions via the Mobile client, which must get Bearer token to run
- [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) stores the ride, and [DynamoDB Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) notifies all clients when a new passengers join the ride.
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) - This is the service that authenticates users.
- [Branch.io](https://branch.io/) - used to generate deep links to join a ride. Since it is not possible to know from what device the passengers will try to join a ride (iOS, Android) or even if they have the app installed, deep links are used.
